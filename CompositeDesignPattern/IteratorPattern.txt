ITERATOR PATTERN

- Helps iterating over collections without exposing their implementation
- It provides a common way to iterate through different types of collections
- The collection will not be responsible for knowing how to iterate over itself.
This will be the responsability of the iterator. In other words, the iteration is ENCAPSULATED
